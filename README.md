# ImageSteganography

This project aims to provide a set of Python scripts which enables anyone to share information hidden in photos.
In the future versions of provided scripts is expected to be able to encrypt this shared data using AES algorithm in multiple modes and block sizes (128, 196 or 256 bits).

# Adopted Technique

For this initial phase, 'Spatial Domain' will be the choosen technique. Also known as substitution technique, this is one of the most simpliest image steganography techniques which consists in changing some of the less significant bits from the RGB values for some pixels in order to store the intended message.

# Encryption Algorithms

Not implemented yet.
